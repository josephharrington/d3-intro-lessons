## D3.js Tutorial ##

### Quickstart ###
This tutorial takes the form of five lessons. Start at the beginning:
 1. Clone the repo and run the webpack server. (See below for commands.)
 1. Load up http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
 2. Open up src/lesson0.js in your favorite text editor.
 3. From there, move on to lesson1.js, lesson2.js, etc. Each lesson builds on the previous one.
 
Feel free to experiment by changing the code! The webpack server will automatically refresh your
browser as you save changes.


#### Clone repo and launch web server ####
```bash
git clone git@gitenterprise.inside-box.net:jharrington/d3_walkthrough.git
cd d3_walkthrough
npm install webpack-dev-server -g

webpack-dev-server --hot --inline
# Load up http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
# Pages will automatically refresh as you save your changes.
```
