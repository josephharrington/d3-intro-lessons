## D3.js Tutorial ##

### Quickstart ###
This tutorial takes the form of five lessons. Start at the beginning:
 1. Clone the repo and run the webpack server. (See below for commands.)
 1. Load up http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
 2. Start reading the code in src/lesson0.js.
 3. From there, move on to lesson1.js, lesson2.js, etc. Each lesson builds on the previous one.

#### Serve with auto-refresh on save ####
